It’s often used for optimization problems where the search space is large and contains many local minima. The algorithm uses a \"temperature\" parameter that controls how much the algorithm allows for exploring worse solutions (higher energy). At the beginning of the process, the temperature is high, allowing the algorithm to accept worse solutions. Over time, the temperature decreases, and the algorithm becomes more conservative."

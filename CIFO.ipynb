In general, even if the algorithms start from an initially high fitness configuration, it still manages to sucessfully decrease the variance of average skill rating between teams within the same league without ever showing an increase, which is ideally what would happen. We made sure which we made sure to implement this, especially for hill climbing which is famous for getting stuck at local optima."
